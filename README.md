# Settle

https://settleit.app

Settle is a tool for groups to make decisions. Each person writes down three unique suggestions, suggestions are crossed off one at a time, and the last suggestion left is the winner.


## Functionality

Guests and registered users both have the ability to create a settle and invite friends via link, email, or text.

Once all participants have submitted their suggestions, the creator of the settle is able to begin settling.
